# Contributing

We appreciate your interest in helping improve [Discourse Graphs](https://github.com/DiscourseGraphs/discourse-graph)! Contributions, whether in code or documentation, are always welcome. ðŸ™Œ

## Start With an Issue

Before diving into a pull request, itâ€™s a good idea to [open an issue](https://github.com/DiscourseGraphs/discourse-graph/issues/new/) to discuss what you have in mind. This ensures your work aligns with the projectâ€™s goals and reduces the chance of duplicating ongoing efforts.

If youâ€™re uncertain about the value of your proposed change, donâ€™t hesitate to create an issue anyway ðŸ˜„. Weâ€™ll review it together, and once we agree on next steps, you can confidently move forward.

2. [Create a new branch](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/managing-branches) for your updates.
